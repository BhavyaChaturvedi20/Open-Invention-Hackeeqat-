# Open-Invention-Hackeeqat-
Explanation of Team Hackeeqat HackOff v3.0 Hackathon Project.

The Avian Eye aims to identify various bird species. 
Our project consists of two parts- Machine Learning Model and Web Application.

The Machine Learning model runs on Keras and Tensorflow.js. We began by importing the labelled dataset from Kaggle onto Google Colab and stored it locally. We set path for training, validation and test set and imported all the necessary libraries. The required layers were added to the model and the optimizer was defined.The Model was trained and its result accuracy was plotted.

In the Web Application, the User Interface was built using HTML and JavaScript. An additional feature, Pet Safety, was added in the form of a carousel which was built using Bootstrap. This provides information on bird safety essential to bird pet owners.
