Explaination of Team Hackeeqat Hackathon Project

The Avian Eye aims to identify various bird species. 
Our project consists of two parts- Machine Learning Model and Web Application.

The Machine Learning model runs on Keras and Tensorflow.js. We began by importing the labelled data set from kaggle on to Google Colab. The data set was unzipped and stored locally. We set path for training validation and test set and then imported all the necessary libraries. The required layers were added to the model and the optimiser was defined. Finally, the model was trained and its result accuracy was plotted.

In the web application, the User Interface was built using HTML and JavaScript. An additional feature, for pet safety, was added in the form of a carousel which was built using Bootstrap.
